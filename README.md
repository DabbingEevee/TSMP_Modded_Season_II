# TSMP Modded Season II

Minecraft Modpack for 1.12.2 Forge  

This quest-based modpack is all about advancing through ages while keeping survival and a fun experience in mind. Ranging from the classic Thermal Expansion to the exotic Ice and Fire, the fun will never end. By starting from the basics of punching a tree and ending by becoming a god, you will soon find yourself immersed in a world full of magic and technology.  

Recommended amount of allocated memory: at least 4 gb  
We recommend adding Optifine for the best performance  
~~If your computer can handle it, shaders will enhance gameplay visually~~
Currently shaders are very broken and if you use Sildur's they won't work at all without the latest preview OptiFine.

# Tips
- Your capsule is your best friend. When used strategically, you have accessible storage, furnaces, and crafting at anytime.  
- Tough as Nails is in this modpack. This means you will have to think about your thirst and temperature. We recommend setting up a camp near water for easy access and have a    campfire handy.  
- Do __not__ mine locked ores. You will break it and only get cobblestone. Wait until you unlock it.  
- A reliable food source is hard to get early-game. An easy food to make is monster jerky. You craft it by putting rotten flesh on drying racks and waiting 4-5 minutes.  
- Be wary of dragons. Until you get really good armor and long ranged weapons, they can easily oneshot you.
