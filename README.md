# TSMP Modded Season II

Minecraft Modpack for 1.12.2 Forge

This quest-based modpack is all about advancing through ages while keeping survival and a fun experience in mind. Ranging from the classic Ender IO or Thermal Expansion, to the exotic Ice and Fire, the fun will never end. Starting from the basic punching a tree and ending by becoming a god, you will soon find yourself immersed in a world full of magic and technology.

# Brief List of Ages:
Basic Survival: Punch the tree or die.  
Stone Age: Welcome to stone tools (and a makeshift gun)!  
Copper Age: What can we do with just copper? You'll find out!  
Magic Age: Magical flowers and weird crystals? Sounds quite epic to me!  
Metallic Age: Tin. Silver. Aluminum. All part of a healthy miner's diet!  
Iron Age: What's that? Three more guns? Now that's pog.  
...  
Modern Age: Isn't technology (and guns) great?  
Space Age: To the mooooon!  
...  
Avarita Age: Singularities? Infinity ingots? I don't like where this going.  
God Age: What do you mean I have to punch a tree again? We are supposed to be gods!
